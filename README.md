## General info
At the beginning, this is an assignment of ITU Functional Programming Course to handle recursive functions with Haskell. Color Manipulation algorithms  that have high dimensions and needed the resolution and 
is the best practice to learn how to analyze understanding functional algorithms flows. 
This code is about the evaluation of the such algorithms according to the given situation. Functional Programming as working with RGB-HSV-NameToRGB-RGBToHSV etc. functions with recursive manner

As we need to import Haskell module to compile Haskell codes.

Run Command:
  1. Find the path in Command Prompt
  2. `ghci` Loading Compile Haskell Module
  3. `:l main.hs`
  4. run function as required.



##Development Environment  
This Project is written on Notepad ++ with Windows 10 Operating Sytstem. Also, This application is tested .
